# Nepal Tourism Data

All data has been taken from the Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal (formerly available in pdf files). A motivation behind this project was to make the data readily available in CSV formats thus making it easier to visualize.

More to be added soon.

## Preprocessing

I use [Tabula](https://pypi.org/project/tabula-py/) for reading pages from the [official pdf files](http://tourism.gov.np/files/statistics/19.pdf) and Pandas for further preprocessing followed by some manual edits.
